# Interactive VAE with MNIST dataset using Pluto.jl

This notebook has been developed using [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl). The code to train the VAE with the MNIST dataset has been taken from [Flux](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/tree/master/vision/vae_mnist) which I modified so that it was interactive.

This notebook is still in development as it would be great to improve the interaction making it smoother.
